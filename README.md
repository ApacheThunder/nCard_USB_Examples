# nCard_USB_Examples
The original dspad and dsmouse USB apps for N-Card and it's clones but converted over to modern libnds!


These applications for Nintendo DS were created as examples for the slot2 USB device N-Card's and their clones used. One acted as a game pad device and the other as a trackpad style mouse.

I have ported these to modern libnds as these apps were really ancient. :P
